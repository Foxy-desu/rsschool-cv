### About me
  Having graduated the university I started my carreer as a teacher of foreign languages at a local foreign language school in Blagoveshchensk. Being a teacher was fun, it also helped a lot in ganing different skills. After 4 years of teaching I found out that this was not my kind of thing.

  Some circumstances made me leave my hometown for another city where I started working as a client support agent for an IT company. This position gave me much experience in communication, problem solving; let me take a closer look at technical side of our service, and business processes in our company. Working with high skilled developers I realized that frontend developing is an interesting IT field. I've started learning and have already obtained some hard skills.

  I believe my strong will, background and passion for frontend will surely lead me to this brand-new profession.

### Non-commercial experience
 ⛩ [Japan Travel Landing](https://github.com/Foxy-desu/Japan_travel_landing)
   
> Working on this project I gained some experience in **CSS _(Flex)_**, **HTML** and **Java Script**;
made an attempt \*not really a successful one\* to implify **BEM** aspects in the project. It also let me take a look at how adaptive layouts are made

📖 [Library Landing](https://github.com/Foxy-desu/Library-landing-project)
   
> This pet-project has been worked on in a more conscious manner. Thanks to 💖**RS School**💖 I obtained more knowledge on how to work with **Java Script events** and **DOM**. The project was not really finished yet, however helped me to become a bit more confident with coding

>These two projects aim at showing a brand new world of **React** and **Redux** for me. Here I first start implementing **SCSS** as well as **AJAX queries**. These projects are way too far from being completed, but at the same time both are too esential for me to remain unspoken about.
